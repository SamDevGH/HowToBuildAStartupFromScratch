In this article, I’ll go over the zeroth step in our startup-building journey—the **PMF Narrative**.

---

Once you’ve got an idea that you believe has the potential to become a product people love (and eventually a business), your goal becomes clear: build the product, get people to use it, and monetize it to turn a profit *consistently.*

This is, in essence, what achieving **Product-Market Fit (PMF)** means 🔥

If you want a more formal (and arguably better) definition, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, defines PMF as:

> “Being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.”
> 

Let’s break this down:

- **Good market** → Your target customers are willing to pay for your product, *and* there are enough of them to sustain your business.
- **Product that can satisfy that market** → Your product is at par with alternative products and provides some unique value on top of it.

So, in our journey to build a startup, we need to do the following:

1. Build a product that can satisfy the target market.
2. Acquire customers from the target market.
3. Monetize.

But wait! All these things are quite resource-intensive. And last I heard, 99% of startups fail. So are we sure that we want to put our limited resources (time, effort, and money) into building *this* startup? 🤔

That’s where **Step 0** comes in — **Pre-MVP Validation**.

# The Danger of Falling in Love with an Idea

You might be aware that when we like something (for whatever reason), we overestimate its positive aspects while underestimating the negatives. This also applies to our own ideas.

Typically, when a person comes up with an idea, they become emotionally attached to it, and end up falling for the same trap.

And when this happens, founders invest time and money into building products that don’t actually have a real market need. ❌

**Step 0 is all about pressure-testing our idea from multiple angles to ensure it has the potential to become a sustainable business—*without our biases getting in the way*.**

The simplest way to do this? **Check how well the idea aligns with the goal of achieving PMF.**

# Enter the PMF Narrative **📜**

We do this through a document called the **PMF Narrative**—a simple Google Doc (or Word file, whatever works) where we break down our idea across six key dimensions essential for achieving PMF:

1. **Problem Statement** — What problem are we solving?
2. **Target Audience** — Who needs this solution the most?
3. **Value Proposition** — Why would they choose our product?
4. **Competitive Advantage** — How are we different from alternatives?
5. **Growth Strategy** — How will we acquire and retain users?
6. **Business Model** — How will we make money?

By creating this document, the idea is no longer just a fleeting thought in your mind—it takes its first step into reality. It becomes tangible, structured, and more concrete.

Moreover, the process of creating this document forces us to think deeper and more critically—not just about our initial idea, but about all the crucial aspects that will ultimately determine its success.

We refine and elaborate on it, adding details where necessary to each key dimension. By the end, your idea goes from being a vague thought in your head to a **full-fledged business strategy**, ready to be put to the test.

Creating the PMF Narrative is just the first half of Step 0 though.

The second half—Validation—is where we actually test the quality of our idea.

So now that we know what the PMF Narrative is and why it’s crucial, let’s start our journey and define Plan’s PMF Narrative.

The first section is on the original idea itself - Initial Insight.

# Initial Insight

This is the “Aha!” moment that made you think, *I could build a startup around this!*

## **Plan’s Initial Insight**

Personal finance for young adults who have recently started earning is mess right now!

First of all, **learning about personal finance is a task**. There is a *lot* to learn but **no clear path to learn** it all.

**Reliable advice is scarce and scattered** all over the internet. And to top it all off, there is tons of *bad* advice all around us which actually works against our best interests.

Even *if* you manage to learn the basics, **managing your finances is again, a task**!

To plan your finances well, you’re supposed to create a budget, spend your money in accordance to it, and track your spending patterns over the long term to ensure that you’re sticking to the budget you created.

However, this is easier said than done because:

- Your financial plans live either in your head or a notebook or in excel.
- Your wealth is scattered across multiple bank accounts, investment accounts, physical investments, crypto, even loans to your friends.
- And finally, the key that connects your wealth to your financial plans — payments — happen on different platforms altogether.

Everything is digital and yet **nothing works together** to make this whole process simpler.

The result? A makeshift, manual approach to personal finance that leaves even well-intentioned individuals frustrated with the whole experience. It’s no wonder most people just wing it and hope for the best.

**But what if there was one app that brought everything together?**

A single place where you could **learn** about personal finance, then **plan, track, and manage** your finances—all without the headache.

That’s the idea behind *Plan*—making money management effortless so you’re not just surviving till the next paycheck, but actually in control of your money.

## Is It a Good Initial Insight?

A strong initial insight has three key characteristics:

1. **It’s earned** → Based on deep personal experience of the problem
2. **It’s unique** → Not an obvious truth that everyone already believes.
3. **It arises from at least one dimension of the PMF Narrative**

Let’s evaluate Plan’s insight against these criteria.

### **1. Earned? ✅**

Good insights often come from one of these sources:

- **Lived experience** → Directly from your personal or professional life.
- **Emergent behavior** → Observing user patterns on existing products.
- **Total immersion** → Deep research, talking to users, testing solutions.

For Plan, my idea came from my own struggles managing personal finances. I experienced the problem firsthand, making this an **earned** insight.

### **2. Unique? ❌**

A great insight isn’t *too* obvious. If everyone immediately agrees with it, it’s not unique enough. If no one agrees with it, well, that's not good either for obvious reasons.

A good litmus test to check this is mixed consensus when we share the idea.

If everyone loves our idea, then it’s an obvious truth, and it therefore fails our unique test. If only 50% of people like it, that’s actually a good thing.

Based on initial conversations I’ve had so far, Plan’s insight resonates with a lot of people—maybe a little too much.

That’s a red flag because obvious insights often lead to undifferentiated solutions.

💡 **How to fix this?**
Since our idea is at risk of being too obvious, we need to focus heavily on differentiation—especially in the Value Proposition and Competitive Advantage sections of our PMF Narrative. More on this later.

### **3. Grounded in PMF Narrative? ✅**

An insight should start from at least one PMF dimension. Usually, this is the “value proposition” dimension, because it’s common to come up with product solution ideas, but it can be any of the dimensions.

Plan’s insight is clearly rooted in the **Value Proposition**—it’s a solution idea.

## **Final Tally**

✅ **Earned** → Comes from personal experience.

❌ **Unique** → Risk of being too obvious.

✅ **Grounded in PMF Narrative** → Aligned with Value Proposition.

# Wrapping Up 🎯

We’ve now covered what the PMF Narrative is, why it matters, and how it helps de-risk our startup idea before investing too much into building it.

Over the next few posts, I’ll be breaking down each of the six dimensions of the PMF Narrative in detail—starting with Problem Statement.

In each post, I’ll break down what that dimension represents, the right frameworks to define it, and finally, apply those insights to shape that dimension for *Plan*.

Note - I picked up the concept of PMF Narrative during a course I took on Reforge around Finding Product-Market Fit. So all credits for this amazing approach to product-building to them.
