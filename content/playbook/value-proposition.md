This is the 5th post in my series on #HowToBuildAStartupFromScratch. So far, I’ve covered:

1. How to get started when you have a new product idea
2. The Product-Market-Fit Narrative — an essential doc for your product’s success
3. How to define the Problem Statement and Target Audience dimensions of the PMF Narrative using a 5-step framework
4. Applying the 5-step framework to define my own product’s Problems to Solve and Target Audience

After doing all this, we know **who we’re building for** and **what their biggest problems are**.

The next question to be answered is:

> “What value will our product actually deliver to customers?”
> 

This is what the next dimension — **Value Proposition** — is all about.

# What is Value Proposition

As I sat down to write this article, I realized something — ‘value proposition’ can be a very confusing term.

I mean I’ve gotten used to hearing it over the years, but if I think about a fresh college-graduate who wants to build their own product, I doubt they’ll intuitively understand what it means when hearing it for the first time.

So, let’s start there:

Simply put, ‘value proposition’ refers to the benefit that we promise to potential customers. It’s like saying “you will get this benefit/*value* by using my product.”

## What Value Proposition is NOT

Many first-time builders often orient their product’s value proposition around some idea they find very “cool”:

- A cool feature,
- Cool design,
- Cool language inside the product, etc.

And that’s a mistake; believe me, I’ve learnt that the hard way.

Defining your value proposition this way leads to a product that doesn't solve real customer problems. Rather, it ends up being a pet project that *you* love, but users won't pay for or use consistently.

So it’s very important to realize early on that your value proposition needs to be about what your *customers* find valuable, and not what *you* think is cool.

### It’s also NOT a feature-listing contest

Another mistake many builders make, is that they try to cram multiple features into their value proposition statement. This also doesn’t work.

People don’t want a task manager because it has 50 features. They want to feel less overwhelmed and more in control of their day. The 50 features are then built to achieve that.

Similarly, people don't want a budgeting app because it has UPI integration and pie charts. What they want is to know if they're spending too much and how to fix it.

Features matter, but only when they clearly deliver the outcome your customer is chasing.

# How to Define your Value Proposition *Correctly*

Before you think about what value you want to promise, you first have to understand what your customers find valuable. That means knowing:

- Who even is your customer
- What they’re trying to achieve,
- Why that matters to them,
- How they’re currently trying to do it, and
- What’s frustrating or broken about their current methods

I covered all of this in my last post and at the time, I said it was to define your product’s **Problem To Solve** and **Target Audience**.

But here's the thing: That wasn’t just ‘Step 1’ of the process. That was the *foundation*.

You can’t figure out what benefit your product should offer until you deeply understand the people you’re trying to help — your customers.

That’s why the PMF Narrative shouldn’t be thought of as a checklist. Rather, it should be treated as a dynamic strategy document where every part feeds into the next.

And if you do your homework on your audience and their world, you'll have a much easier time deciding what value you should offer to them.

# The Real Value Canvas: A 4-Step Framework

I’ve created a lightweight, practical framework by blending some of the most effective tools in product-thinking to define value propositions:

- **Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)**
- **Use-Case Mapping**
- **Value Proposition Canvas**

*ℹ️ I recommend exploring and learning about each of these frameworks anyway, but if you’re short on time, you can refer to the blended framework I’ve created below.*

I call it *The Real Value Canvas* — a simple way to define your value prop in a way that actually connects with users.

### Step 1: Clarify the Desired Outcome

> What is your user really trying to achieve?
> 

Forget your idea for a moment.

What *goal* is your customer trying to accomplish? What change do they want to see in their life? What result would make them feel like the problem is solved?

This is the emotional or practical **outcome** they’re hoping for.

Examples:

- "I want to feel in control of my money."
- "I want to stop feeling overwhelmed by my daily tasks."
- "I want to be able to afford the things I care about."

The *outcome* is what really matters to customers. Your product is just a means to get there.

💡 **Pro tip:** The best value propositions sound like something your user would say *after* using your product.

> "This app helps me stay on top of my spending without thinking about it."
> 

That’s infinitely more powerful than:

> "AI-based real-time transaction categorization"
> 

### Step 2: Define the Promised Benefit

> What specific benefit will your product deliver to help the user get that outcome?
> 

A **benefit** is the positive result customer gets from using your product. Not what your product does technically, but what they get out of it.

Benefits usually fall into three broad categories:

- **Functional** — the task gets done more easily or more effectively
    
    > “I can track my expenses without needing Excel.”
    > 
- **Emotional** — the user feels something positive or avoid feeling something negative
    
    > “I don’t feel anxious about my finances anymore.”
    > 
- **Financial** — the user gains or saves money/time/resources
    
    > “I’ve started saving ₹5,000 more each month thanks to this app.”
    > 

A good value proposition typically delivers one or more of these, while achieving the outcome you figured out in Step 1.

### Step 3: Map Benefits to Features

> How does your product actually deliver the benefit(s)?
> 

Now, and only now, we arrive at the point where you can discuss features and those cool ideas you're passionate about.

List all the features you have in your head while briefly describing what they’ll do and how they’ll work. You don’t need to be super detailed here, just surface-level details would do.

Then, pick those features that are delivering the promised benefit(s) identified in step 2.

These are the features that are truly important for your product’s success, the rest are non-essential.

That’s not to say that non-essential features will never be useful. It just means that they aren’t essential for the first version of your product. You can always come back to the list and decide to add them once you’ve built v1, and got some feedback on it.

Every feature should have a reason to exist, and that reason should be rooted in the promised benefit(s).

## Step 4: Combine!

Once you know:

- The outcome your customers want,
- The benefits they’ll value, and
- The key features that deliver those benefits,

You’re finally ready to finally write your value proposition statement.

To do this, simply combine the information you’ve collected so far into a coherent statement:

> “[Product name] helps [target audience] [achieve desired outcome] by [delivering benefit] through [your key features or approach].
> 

For example:

**Notion**

> Notion helps knowledge workers stay organized by combining documents, tasks, and databases into one simple workspace.
> 

**Duolingo**

> We help language learners build a daily habit by turning lessons into a game.
> 

**Plan** (early draft — can change in the next post)

> We help young earners feel in control of their money by connecting their plans, payments, and balances in one simple system.
> 

# What's Next?

And that’s it!

By following this simple 4-step framework, you can define your product’s value proposition while avoiding the common mistakes that doom startups, and offer something that feels truly valuable to customers.

In the next post, I'll show how I'm applying *The Real Value Canvas* to **Plan**, the budgeting app I'm building, so you can see theory *and* real-world application.
